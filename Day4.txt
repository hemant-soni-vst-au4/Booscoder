// complexity

TC help in analysis runtime of algorithm 
algorithm => process/ formula to solve a problem 

Compare the runtime
-> Hardware dependent
-> extra human resource required

We need better mechanism to compare algorithm => Time complexity

how number of operations taken by algo increase w.r.t. input 

input increase but operation are constant => O(1)
operation directly proportion to input => O(n)


O(n2) => Quadratic => sorting - bubble and insertion
O(logn) => Binary search => on each step problem is divided into 2 half => divide & conquer => greatest common diviser
O(nlogn) => Quick sort & merge sort 
O(1) => Hashing 

most imp => hashing, binary search, graph

Why less time complexity required? => writting algorithm which take lesser time => optimal solution


for(let i=0; i<n; i++) {
  for(let j = 0; i < 100; j++) {
    console.log(i*j)
  }
}

Sir time complexity in this case will be O(n);
